Test Task for Webtronics

Steps to deploy the project:
1. Clone the project to your device
2. This project is run from containers, so if Docker is not installed on your device, you must install it.


      Installation instructions are here:
      * [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
      * [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04-ru)
      * [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=Windows-Server)
3. Type the following command in the terminal `docker-compose up --build`.
Building the project for the first time will take about 2 minutes (next times it will be much faster)
4. Follow the link in the terminal and add `/docs` to the end of the host address
5. Now you can view the project made according to [the terms of reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZMjuXB0DnioQW7w30mrsA2WYzcdbWII4omgPvdPGQo/edit#)
